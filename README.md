Jejak Pancasila - A Journey of Choices and Values

"Jejak Pancasila" is a 2D scrolling pixel art game inspired by classic games like Life is a Game, where you embark on a journey through three significant stages of life: elementary school (SD), high school (SMA), and adulthood as a working professional. In this game, your choices and interactions with others will shape your destiny, influenced by the principles of Pancasila or swayed by negative elements.

Plot / Gameplay:

Players move automatically to the right, navigating through life's important stages. Along the way, players can jump and make choices using buttons, interacting with NPCs (Non-Player Characters) who seek help. Helping NPCs will shape your journey, just as the items you collect will influence your character's growth and outcome.

The game incorporates items that represent the core values of Pancasila, Indonesia's foundational philosophy. Buff items, like the bull, rice, and star, symbolize the five pillars of Pancasila, empowering the player. However, beware of nerf items like cigarettes and sickles that represent negative influences, hindering your progress.

At the end of the journey, your decisions and the items you collect will determine one of three possible endings. Will you emerge as a true follower of Pancasila, or will your journey take a darker turn?

Main features:

3 Life Stages: Navigate through SD, SMA, and adult life, making important decisions along the way.
Choice-based Gameplay: Interact with NPCs and choose whether to help them, shaping your outcome.
Buffs and Nerfs: Collect items representing good (Pancasila values) or bad (negative influences) that will affect your journey.

How to play:
